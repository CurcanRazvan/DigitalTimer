# Digital Timer - University Practice Project

This is the project I built for my 2nd-year university practice module. It is a digital timer designed in KiCad, capable of counting seconds (0-59) and displaying them on two 7-segment displays.

### Technical Overview

The circuit is designed with a modular approach:
1.  **Clock Signal:** Generated by an **NE555** timer configured as an astable oscillator.
2.  **Counting:** Handled by two **74LS193** 4-bit synchronous binary counters (U7 and U8).
3.  **Decoding & Display:** The binary signal is converted for the 7-segment displays using **CD4511** decoders.

**Logic Control:**
I used additional logic gates (**74LS73, 74LS08, CD4071**) to handle the counting limit (resetting at 60) and the Up/Down direction control.

### Schematic
Here is the final schematic, which includes the corrections needed for everything to work properly:

### v1.0 & Debugging

After getting the PCB manufactured and soldering the components, I spotted a mistake in the initial schematic: Pin 11 (Load) on the counters wasn't connected to 5V, and the C4 capacitor (47uF) wasn't linked to resistor R17.

**The Fix:**
I fixed this directly on the board by adding two jumper wires on the bottom layer.
* The red wires visible in the photo below connect the pins to 5V and route the capacitor correctly.
* With these changes, the circuit works perfectly.

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

The total cost for the project (components + PCB + shipping) was approximately 140 Lei (~$30).
